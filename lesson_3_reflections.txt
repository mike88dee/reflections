When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You may wish to use a remote repository if you are working on a computer in a different location i.e at home.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you may need to deal with conflicts especially where other are contributing to code.
