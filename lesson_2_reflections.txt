How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area collects the files you are working on and then saves the changes to each file as one commit.
It enables you to make changes to related files and track that relationship.
The editor is not opening automatically I think this may have something to do with periods in the file path.
Ok I have changes the name to omit the periods to see if that cures the commit problem.
Founf the problem - copied the correct file path from course notes to remove back slashes from file name and hey presto!

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Check which filkes have changed in the working area using git status then move these files to the staging area to make one commit for the change you have made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

when you want to make a related version of the file such as a different language or an alternative layout but also want to have the original version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
using git command git log --graph --oneline branch_name branch_name you can create a disgram of the relevant commit history and see when the branch was created and how it relates to the other branch.
